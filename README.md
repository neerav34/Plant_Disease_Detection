# Plant Disease Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
This project aims to help in the early identification and management of plant diseases through the power of deep learning. The system utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of plants into 38 distinct categories, covering a wide range of plant species and their associated diseases. The goal is to provide accurate detection to aid farmers and agricultural professionals in taking timely action to mitigate crop damage.

## Features

### Image Classification: 
The CNN model is trained to identify 38 different plant diseases with high accuracy. The model analyzes input images and returns predictions based on learned patterns from a large labeled dataset.

### User-Friendly Interface: 
The project employs Streamlit for the frontend, allowing users to easily upload images of plants and receive real-time classification results.

### End-to-End Pipeline: 
From data preprocessing and model training to prediction and visualization, the project provides a complete pipeline for plant disease detection.

## Technology Stack

### Deep Learning: 
The core model is built using CNN, leveraging libraries like TensorFlow/Keras to train and evaluate the model.

### Frontend: 
Streamlit provides an interactive web-based frontend, making the tool accessible and easy to use.

### Backend: 
Python-based backend manages image preprocessing, model inference, and the integration of the frontend with the model.

## Dataset and Training

The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of plant images, which includes multiple samples of diseased and healthy plants. The images are preprocessed to ensure consistency in input dimensions, and various data augmentation techniques are applied to improve the model's generalization capabilities.

## Results and Insights

The model achieves high accuracy on test datasets, demonstrating robustness in identifying plant diseases across diverse conditions. The system provides predictions in real-time, making it an effective tool for early disease detection and management in agricultural settings.

## Future Work

Potential improvements include expanding the dataset, optimizing the model for faster inference, and implementing cloud deployment to make the tool more accessible on mobile devices.
